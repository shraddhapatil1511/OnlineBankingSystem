Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings, find the minimum number of rooms required to hold all the meetings.

 

 

Example 1:

 

Meetings: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]] Output: 2 Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we need two rooms to hold these two meetings. [7,9] can occur in any of the two rooms later.

 

 

 

Example 2

 

Meetings: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]] Output: 1 Explanation: None of the meetings overlap, therefore we only need one room to hold all meetings.
